# Learning the effects of undersampling in image reconstruction using Deep Learning Frequency Domain - Diffuse Optical Tomography
## Background
Near Infrared (NIR) light is being extensively researched as an alternative source for medical imaging due to its non-ionizing nature and ability to penetrate deep into tissues. The wavelength range for NIR typically spans from about 700 nm to 2500 nm, with the 700-900 nm window being particularly relevant for medical imaging because it optimally balances tissue penetration depth with minimal absorption by water and hemoglobin.

NIR technology is utilized in various medical fields, including functional brain imaging, muscle oxygenation studies, and cancer detection, showcasing its versatility. In terms of imaging techniques, NIR can be utilized in two different ways: either by sending a continuous wave (CW) of NIR light into the tissue or by employing frequency-modulated imaging, where the frequency of the NIR light alternates between two or three frequencies. Empirically, the frequency-modulated approach tends to yield higher quality images due to its ability to provide detailed information about tissue properties and depth, albeit at a higher cost compared to CW-NIR imaging.

The mechanism behind NIR imaging involves strategically placing a series of light sources and detectors on the part of the human body being scanned. When NIR light is emitted into the tissues, it interacts with the tissues and is either absorbed or scattered. The scattered light is then captured by the detectors. Two key aspects of the detected light are analyzed: the intensity of the light and the phase shift (i.e., this can cause both a delay in time (time lag) and a shift in the phase of the light wave relative to the original light wave). These characteristics are crucial as they help differentiate between various types of tissues based on their optical properties, including differences that allow for imaging functional aspects of the tissue, such as blood flow or oxygenation levels. With this information, it is possible to reconstruct an image of the underlying tissues, providing valuable insights for medical diagnosis and treatment planning.
